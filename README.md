# Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch

## 1. Overview:
This project implements a **Deep Q-Learning** approach using PyTorch. Deep Q-Learning combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to solve complex decision-making tasks. The primary goal of this project is to train an agent capable of learning optimal policies through interactions with its environment.

---

## 2. Features:
- Implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** for reinforcement learning.
- PyTorch-based implementation for easy extensibility.
- Supports replay memory and target networks.
- Configurable hyperparameters for learning and exploration.

---

## 3. How It Works:
1. **Environment Interaction**:  
   The agent interacts with the environment to gather experiences in the form of states, actions, rewards, and next states.
   
2. **Replay Memory**:  
   Experiences are stored in a memory buffer to decorrelate data and improve training stability.

3. **Deep Q-Network**:  
   A neural network estimates the Q-value for each state-action pair.

4. **Optimization**:  
   The network is optimized using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the difference between predicted and target Q-values.

5. **Target Network**:  
   A separate network is used to calculate stable target Q-values during training.

6. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**:  
   An epsilon-greedy policy balances exploration of new actions with exploitation of the learned policy.
